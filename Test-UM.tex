  \begin{block}{Challenges in activities in human and biped humanoid robots}
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item Activity like jogging, running might cause an accident event such as fall. This might cause damage to the human body or to the structural components of the robot.
  		
  		\item Immediate identification of a fall will allow fast responses, and in case of robots it might be able to corrects its motion to prevent accident.
  		
  		\item Though both human and biped humanoid robots share lots of similar  features, using same framework it never has been tested to use external embedded devices to identify activities on both.

	\begin{block}{Motivation}
		 \begin{itemize}
		 	\item Humans and biped humanoid robots have almost identical movements and are  susceptible to similar accidents, we believe that the same set of learning algorithms
		 	are suitable for both groups.
		 	\item We want to use off-the-shelf hardware components to develop our sensing tools.
		 	\item We want to develop a generalized approach for learning and predicting
		 	activities of both groups.
		 	
		 	\item  Detection of falls for both humans and robots within a unified framework;

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Our framework provides generic functionalities to develop applications or rational agents on embedded devices.
			\item The execution paths is ensured using a topologically sorted graph, based on the decision points provided by practitioners.
			\item The framework includes: 
			\begin{enumerate}
			 \item tools to develop modules and representations that execute on the microcontrollers or off-line, 
			\item the methods to access functionalities for physical robots, and 
			\item a real-time visualization system
			\end{enumerate}.
			\item Our development framework, $\mu$Energia (\textit{pronounced as}: ``micro--Energia'' and 
			\textit{site}:
			{http://muenergia.saminda.org}), uses a notion of  {\em modules} and {\em representations} to 
			perform computations.

	\begin{block}{Feature Extraction}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item we sampled with 50$Hz$ sampling rate. 
		\item In order to identify activities: 
		\begin{enumerate} \item we have used a window size of $400ms$ (20 
				samples); and \item we have allowed 10 samples ($200ms$) to overlap between windows. 
			\end{enumerate} 
			\item The selection of the window size is based on the observation that transition from routine  activities to a fall event 
			takes between $180-250ms$. 
			\item Thus, a window size of $400ms$ will include both fall event and 
			non-fall event data for classification

		\begin{itemize}
			\item For a threshold-based decision making, we have filtered the roll, pitch, and
			yaw values using a Kalman filter.
			\item If filtered roll values are within $[90\pm15^{\circ}]$ and the filtered pitch values are within  $[0\pm15]^{\circ}$, then with 100\% 
			accuracy, the NAO  robot will be in a normal state. Otherwise the robot 
			is in a fallen state.
			\item If the filtered roll value is less that $60^{\circ}$ 
			, the robot is falling forward. If the filtered roll values is 
			more than 100$^{\circ}$, then it is falling backward.
			\item If the filtered pitch value is less than -50$^{\circ}$, the robot is falling to the left side, while if the 
			filtered pitch values is more than 50$^{\circ}$,then it is falling to the right 
			side.
			\item  With these thresholds for a separate test cases, the thresholding method has detected fallen 
			state with 100\% accuracy.
